### Skill-enhancing
* [A Programmer's Introduction to Mathematics](https://pimbook.org): this book did an excellent job of teaching me how to engage with mathematics in a joyful, curious, and practiceable way.
* [Thinking in Systems: A Primer](https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Systems-Donella-H-Meadows/dp/1603580557) by Donella H. Meadows: this book did an excellent job of showing me how to do root-cause-analysis. Particularly the archetypical problems and their solutions are extremely insightful. See for example [this systems design post](https://apenwarr.ca/log/20201227) for examples about archetypical problems in modern product engineering.
* [Systems Thinking for Journalists](https://www.systems.journalismdesign.com/visualize-systems-in-reporting): carrying out this list of questions (for events in the news or in my own life) helps me to get to a greater understanding of the stories in the world. 
* I think that there is a market for a website that combines a neutral "breaking news" archive (like [NOS](https://nos.nl)) with a systems-thinking context (like [The Correspondent](https://decorrespondent.nl/)). For example, I don't only want to read that the latest government IT project runs years late and over budget -- I also want to read little snippets to answer many related questions like (1) what is the situation in other countries, (2) since when have IT projects been running late and over budget, and is it getting better or worse, (3) do all government projects run over time and over budget, or is only the IT projects, and why, (4) what methods have been tried to prevent this from happening, and why have they failed, (5) what can the governement try next time, ... . I think that [The Correspondent](https://decorrespondent.nl/) fails in its job because the articles they write are not linked to news-as-it-happens and, hence, are not inherently interesting. I think that [Quartz](https://qz.com) is an excellent step in this direction.

### Life-enhancing
* [Get Out of Your Mind and Into Your Life](https://www.amazon.com/Get-Your-Mind-Into-Life/dp/1572244259) by Steven Hayes: this is a life-changing book, about how to deal with negative thoughts and feelings. See [this TEDx talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnSHpBRLJrQ) for a short primer on the topic, and [this TEDx talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o79_gmO5ppg) that shows his very personal perspective on the topic.
* [The Happiness Trap](https://www.amazon.com/Happiness-Trap-Struggling-Start-Living/dp/1590305841) by Russ Harris: this is a great companion-book to the previous one, as Russ Harris does a better job of explaining many of the concepts in Steven Hayes' book in clear and concise language. Has an Android app associated with it, too.
* An awareness of [Flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)), without having to actually read the book, is immensely helpful. Flow (or 'being in the zone') is when you are so involved in an activity that you forget time and/or your troubles and yourself, and is associated with immense levels of hapiness. Sadly, a state of flow is most often reached at work only. Making things slightly harder is a simple way to create flow and increase your satisfaction at home (cut garlic as finely as you can; try and cook a whole meal within 30 minutes; ...).
* [Difficult Conversations](https://www.amazon.com/Difficult-Conversations-Discuss-What-Matters/dp/0143118447) by Douglas Stone, Bruce Patton, and Sheila Heen: this is a great book about how to navigate difficult conversations in an assertive (but non-violent and non-agressive) way.
* [The Cognitive Shuffle](https://mysleepbutton.com/support/do-it-yourself-cognitive-shuffle-sdi/): this is the best method that helps me falling asleep that I know of. I've found that "clearing the mind", using mindfulness/force, is not an effective way to get rid of a spinning mind at the end of the day at all, despite it being recommended often. My experience is in line with Steven Hayes' assertion that your mind will only amplify the things you try to ignore. This suffle technique instead fills your mind with absolutely random things, to get you in that groggy dream-like sleep state. That is, you distract yourself asleep. It works wonders!
* [Loop Habit Tracker](https://loophabits.org): this app changed my life. It's simple -- you can tick a box whenever you finish an activity. It is very gratifying, and gamifies otherwise boring daily chores.

### Research-related
* [Wolfram Alpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com): a miraculous tool that can solve many math problems and plot any normal function.
* [Hemingway App](http://www.hemingwayapp.com): a tool that highlights verbiose writing. Nothing less, and nothing more. Extremely helpful in the editing process of a text, as it helps to distill many phrases into their shortest possible units.
* [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com): a very helpful tool to fix a multitude of grammar and spelling mistakes.
