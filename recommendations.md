### Skill-enhancing
* [A Programmer's Introduction to Mathematics](https://pimbook.org): this book did an excellent job of teaching me how to engage with mathematics in a joyful, curious, and practicable way.
* [Thinking in Systems: A Primer](https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Systems-Donella-H-Meadows/dp/1603580557) by Donella H. Meadows: this book did an excellent job of showing me how to do root-cause-analysis. Particularly the archetypical problems and their solutions are extremely insightful. See for example [this systems design post](https://apenwarr.ca/log/20201227) for examples about archetypical problems in modern product engineering.
* [Systems Thinking for Journalists](https://www.systems.journalismdesign.com/visualize-systems-in-reporting): Carrying out this list of questions (for events in the news or in my own life) helps me to get to a greater understanding of the stories in the world. 
* I think that there is a market for a website that combines a neutral "breaking news" archive (like [NOS](https://nos.nl)) with a systems-thinking context (like [The Correspondent](https://decorrespondent.nl/)). For example, I don't only want to read that the latest government IT project runs years late and over budget -- I also want to read little snippets to answer many related questions (1) what is the situation in other countries, (2) since when has this been happening, (3) do all government projects run over time and over budget, or is only the IT projects, and why, (4) what methods have been tried to prevent this from happening, and why have they failed, (5) what can the governement try next time, ... . I think that [The Correspondent](https://decorrespondent.nl/) fails in its job because the articles they write are not linked to news as-it-happens and, hence, not inherently interesting.

### Life-enhancing
* [Get Out of Your Mind and Into Your Life](https://www.amazon.com/Get-Your-Mind-Into-Life/dp/1572244259) by Steven Hayes: this is a life-changing book, about how to deal with negative thoughts and feelings. See [this TEDx talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnSHpBRLJrQ) for a short primer on the topic, and [this TEDx talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o79_gmO5ppg) that shows a very personal perspective on the topic.
* [The Happiness Trap](https://www.amazon.com/Happiness-Trap-Struggling-Start-Living/dp/1590305841) by Russ Harris: this is a great companion-book to the previous one, as Russ Harris does a better job of explaining many of the concepts in Steven Hayes' book in clear and concise language. Has an Android app associated with it, too.
* [Difficult Conversations](https://www.amazon.com/Difficult-Conversations-Discuss-What-Matters/dp/0143118447) by Douglas Stone, Bruce Patton, and Sheila Heen: this is a great book about how to navigate difficult conversations in an assertive (but non-violent and non-agressive) way.
