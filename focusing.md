I came across *Inner Relationship Focusing* a year ago. I thought it was just weird new wavy bullshit, but I've found it to be actually rather helpful.

My understanding of the method is that you create a space in your body to meet yourself. I know it sounds stupid. But hear me out. You create a space to get a sense on how you're feeling, deep down. 

## Zoom in on how you're feeling
#### Take 30 seconds to feel your body. Are you feeling
<div>
<input type="radio" name="optradio">Feeling light 
<input type="radio" name="optradio" checked>Intermediate
<input type="radio" name="optradio">Feeling heavy
</div>

#### Where in the body do I sense something taking my attention (e.g., tightness, pressure, a knocking feeling, ...)
<div>
<input type="radio" name="optradio">My chest
<input type="radio" name="optradio" checked>My belly
<input type="radio" name="optradio"> <input type="text" value="My ...">
</div>

#### Welcome the feeling, say "I am sensing ... in me, and I'm saying hello to that feeling"
