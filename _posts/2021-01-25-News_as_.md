I have a lot of different conceptualizations about news, what it is, and what it should do. Some of those views are compatible, but they aren't always. It probably means that "news" is a multi-faceted concept, serving different needs for different people. Still, I think it's useful for me to write down my conceptualizations in a bit more clarity.

#### 1. News as a calibration of normalcy and outrage

When I was preparing food for 30 kids at a scouting camp, 5 years ago, I had to cut a few kilograms of bell peppers. My strategy: cut them in half, cut off the green stem, and chop up the rest. That is just one of the available options, but it's the one I knew.

What I didn't know at the time was that one is supposed to de-seed a pepper, i.e., throw the seeds and all the white bits of the pepper away. My cooking mates at the camp told me that I was supposed to do this, and I thanked them. See, if no one ever tells you how things are supposed to be or supposed to be done, and you wouldn't learn it otherwise, there is no way to otherwise get this knowledge.
