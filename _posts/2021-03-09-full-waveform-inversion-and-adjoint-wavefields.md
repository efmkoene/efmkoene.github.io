Being an exploration geophysicist by training, I am quite familiar with the ideas underlying reverse-time migration. It's a really rather simple method. We can say that, roughly speaking, a wavefield is composed of two parts: a source wavefield (which travels into the earth and is transmitted on each rock interface) and a receiver wavefield (which is generated at places where the source wavefield hits the interface between two rocks and which creates a reflection off those interfaces back up towards the surface). If you can get your hands on those two, separate, wavefields, then it is a simple observation to make that only at those locations where the source & reflected (or 'receiver') wavefield coincide in space and time, a rock interface was present.
