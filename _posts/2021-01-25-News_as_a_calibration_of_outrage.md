I have a lot of different conceptualizations about news, what it is, and what it should do. Some of those views are compatible, but they aren't always. It probably means that "news" is a multi-faceted concept, serving different needs for different people. Still, I think it's useful for me to write down my conceptualizations in a bit more clarity.

#### Calibration as a continuous routine positioning itself within extremes

When I was preparing food for 30 kids at a scouting camp, 5 years ago, I had to cut a few kilograms of bell peppers. My strategy: cut them in half, cut off the green stem and the white bit with which the stem connects to the inside of the pepper, and chop up the rest. That is just one of the many available techniques, but it's the one I knew.

What I didn't know at the time was that one is supposed to fully de-seed a pepper, i.e., throw away all the seeds. It was only because my cooking mates told me ("it's what you're supposed to do"), that I now always de-seed my peppers when cooking. The seeds [are not toxic and actually contains valuable nutrients][https://www.hortidaily.com/article/6017576/don-t-throw-away-these-bell-pepper-seeds/], but they just leave an unwanted texture in many dishes.

You figure out what is normal in life only through continuous exposure to a somewhat fixed set of ideas, behavior, and interactions. If not through other people's guidance or example, it's through culture (TV, movies, books, etcetera). Essentially, our brain is carrying out a constant calibration routine; *determining true value spaces in a gradated world*. That is not to say that our behavior is that easily programmed -- for example, [there is no link between playing violent video games and violent behavior][https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2020/03/violent-video-games-behavior]. Clearly, humans are capable of steering their calibration routines in safe ways.

When I was young, I spent so many hours of my life playing [Star Wars: Rogue Squadron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_Rogue_Squadron) using a joystick. Before every game, I had to do a calibration of the joystick. It told me to push the joystick as far in any direction as I could. It would then know what deviation on the joystick corresponded to what intended move. I think that most calibration routines in your brain work in a similar way. Only when you are aware of the normal extremes, you can properly see what a deviation from normal amounts to. For example, I was under the impression that I earn less than the average Swiss person, on my PhD salary combined with that of my girlfriend's. When filling out a test on [https://www.compareyourincome.org][https://www.compareyourincome.org], I assumed that 70% of Swiss people earned more than we did; it turned out that we earn more than 70% of Swiss people instead! It appears that I'm not well calibrated when it comes to the topic of incomes, but it's because most of my friends and social contacts are earning more than we do, so it seems sensible to assume we're not that rich. It shows that our sense of "normal" can be quite out of touch with reality. Another famous example that went around the world many times the past few years, is that [the world is statistically speaking better in essentially every possible way, yet so many people feel everything is getting worse every year][https://www.forbes.com/sites/robasghar/2020/06/20/things-keep-getting-better-heres-why-your-brain-thinks-theyre-getting-worse/].
