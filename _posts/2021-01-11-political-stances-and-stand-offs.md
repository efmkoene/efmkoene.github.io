The topic of this blog is to investigate the following question:

{: .box-note}
Where do people's political stances come from? Can they change?

Political stances are (probably) the biggest source of disagreement and conflict in societies and families, making this question relevant.

In the US, [the Democratic and Republican parties take roughly half the votes each presidential election, for well over 300 years](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/76/PartyVotes-Presidents.png). This is despite the fact that these parties have changed their policies over time. Indeed, the Republican party chose [not to write a platform (i.e., new policy ideas) for the 2020 election](https://www.vox.com/2020/8/24/21399396/republican-convention-platform-2020-2016). This to me hints at the possibility that people's political affiliation with the parties (or their leaders) is stronger than the specific policies that these parties support.

{: .box-warning}
**1.** Democratic/Republican parties divided votes in a 50/50 ratio, despite changes in time as to what these parties actually stand for. So, people's political stance appears more constant in the population than people's actual support for certain policies.

Most political parties like to position themselves on a [political spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_spectrum). This is a space divided with arbitrary axes (left-right, progressive-conservative, big governement-small governement, ...). A crucial feature of the political spectrum is that the origin is not fixed -- neither in time (the conservative aim to preserve the status quo is not what it was 200 years ago) nor in place (the "left" leaning Democratic party is a [center-right party when compared to European parties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_spectrum#Historical_origin_of_the_terms)). I think the political spectrum is interesting for two reasons. First of all: the lack of an origin means that, e.g., right-wing ideas can seem more "centrist" (i.e., moderate) when more extremist ideas are introduced. This has political consequences when politics are discussed within the view of a spectrum (as they nearly always are).

{: .box-warning}
**2.** The "centrist" views of politics exist only relative to extremist political views. Even when an extremist candidate/party fails to gain power, they still have the ability to morph the spectrum in their direction. Put differently, the fact that person X is not "far-right", doesn't mean they are "left" -- but they are often made out to be such. 

Second of all, the political spectrum is like a game of Monopoly. Parties want to get the most votes. Put differently, they want to conquer as much usable space on the political spectrum as possible -- and steal from the other party where possible. Ideally, this means that you draw up policies that appeal to a majority of the population and get their support. This is how we traditionally see elections. A moderating force in in place where [parties steal policy ideas from another party, and then ostracize them](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402382.2017.1332328). This should generally drive parties to more moderate policies (with the note that "moderate" is governed by point \#2 up here). But there are two more ways of succeeding at the goal: (1) remain as vague as possible about your actual policies, such that your ideas simultaneously appeal to both extremist and moderate people on the political spectrum, (2) present the other parties' ideas as sufficiently *different* and in such a way that their policies appear to take up minimal space on the political spectrum (e.g., by saying they the other parties' policies are *extremist*, you may scare people away who do not identify as extremist).

{: .box-warning}
**3.** An effective way of winning space on the political spectrum is to act in bad faith: steal policy ideas from other parties and rally people around vague policies (to appeal to a varied space on the spectrum) and demonize another party about their specific policies (to paint them into a far-away corner on the political spectrum). Having specific policies can then become a liability rather than an asset.

One of the primary objectives of US political parties these days is to keep the opposing party out of power. [This is not controversial, and is behavior found on both 'sides'](https://democracy.psu.edu/poll-report-archive/americans-not-only-divided-but-baffled-by-what-motivates-their-opponents/). Charicatures are the name of the game here. For example, Fox News will tell you that voting Democrat will turn the country into a communist (or Islamist?) nation with open borders, millions of immigrants raping and terrorizing the people, etcetera. This dynamic can be explained rather well with the previous point. But I would also hypothesize that this particular situation only appears in a winner-takes-all democracy. In a democracy with many parties that have to form coalitions to rule (as widespread in Europe), being "not-the-other-parties" is not unique enough. Why? Well, it is a stance easily parroted by other parties, after which it loses its partilarly divisive power.

{: .box-warning}
**4.** A winner-takes-all electoral system (as found in practice in the US, the UK, ...) turns politics into much more divisive us-vs-them elections. In this setting, again, having specific policies is more of a liability than an asset.

Political stances, on average, correlate with (1) geography (e.g., north-south divides, rural-city divides, [geological history](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidbressan/2020/11/03/how-us-presidential-elections-are-impacted-by-geology/), ...), (2) [socio-economic-cultural classes](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/06/02/in-changing-u-s-electorate-race-and-education-remain-stark-dividing-lines/) (e.g., rich-poor, black-white-Latino, ...), (3) biology and psychology (e.g., see [twin-study research](https://www.jstor.org/stable/27754535), [neurological and psychological research](https://neuro.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/appi.neuropsych.16030051), ...). What, then, is the point of a political debate, if someone's political stance is already decided to a large degree? Indeed, [a study in 1978 already found no evidence that a presidential debate made people change their minds about who to vote for](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2110467). [And this generally holds true today](https://journalistsresource.org/studies/politics/elections/presidential-debates-effects-research-roundup/). Only when a political candidate makes a gaffe (e.g., appearing stupid, unpresidential, not caring, ...), there may be negative consequences for a political vote.

{: .box-warning}
**5.** Political debates are a not-so important factor in changing people's voting behavior.

Hence, I come to the following opinion I've formed on the topic.

{: .box-note}
People have a feeling of where they stand on the political spectrum (e.g., one may identify themselves as a "center-left progressive big-government with interest in Green issues"). They then *look* for a party that confirms these choices (i.e., not via persuasion by policy ideas, but via alignment between the party's place in the political spectrum and themselves). The political spectrum is shaped by the most extreme voices. The position of a political party on the political spectrum is thus relative to these extreme voices, and relative to other parties. Following this argument, we can expect US politics to always be split roughly 50/50 between Republicans and Democrats, because it seems that people are simply split about 50/50 between feeling "liberal" and "conservative", regardless of the actual policies of these parties.
