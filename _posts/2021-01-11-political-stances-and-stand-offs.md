The topic of this blog is to investigate the following question:

{: .box-note}
Where do people's political stances come from? Can they change?

Political stances are, probably, the biggest source of disagreement and conflict in humans. They can ruin family reunions, dinner dates, and lead to physical harm. This is perhaps of little surprise. After all, politics deals with great power. The power to shape the future. Having a political stance thus corresponds to knowing an answer to the question _"what kind of world do you want?"_ The answers to this question can broadly be placed on a ["conservative-to-liberal" spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_spectrum). The conservative stance favors traditional values and the status quo (hence: the future should be like the present). The liberal stance favors change and a more egalitarian society (hence: the future should be different from the present).^0

Since the foundation of the USA, votes have primarily been divided between a conservative (Repubiclan) and a liberal (Democratic) party. For example, see the following [graph from Wikimedia](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/76/PartyVotes-Presidents.png) about presidential election results spanning over 300 years:

Two features stand out. First of all, the conservative and liberal parties are fairly well balanced, both taking roughly half of the votes every year. The margin of one party over the other is never larger than 27%.



^0 Note that this single-axis depiction of politics is far too simple to depict real political stances. Political parties typically differentiate themselves with an economic component (left-right), next to their socio-cultulra stance (conservative-liberal), effectively creating a 2-D plane on which political parties are situated.
