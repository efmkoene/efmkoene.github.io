The topic of this blog is to investigate the following question:

{: .box-note}
Where do people's political stances come from? Can they change?

Political stances are (probably) the biggest source of disagreement and conflict in societies and families. This is not about why people care about politics; but about why they take a political stance. In the US, [the Democratic and Republican parties take roughly half the votes each presidential election, for well over 300 years](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/76/PartyVotes-Presidents.png). This is despite the fact that these parties have changed their policies over time. Indeed, the Republican party chose [not to write a platform (with policy ideas) for the 2020 election, instead focusing on leadership and keeping the other party out](https://www.vox.com/2020/8/24/21399396/republican-convention-platform-2020-2016). This hints at the possibility that people's political affiliation with the parties (or their leaders) is stronger than the specific policies that these parties support.

**1.** Democratic/Republican parties divided votes in a 50/50 ratio, despite changes in time as to what these parties actually stand for. So, people's political stance appears more constant in the population than people's actual support for certain policies.

Most political parties like to position themselves on a [political spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_spectrum). This is a space divided with arbitrary axes (left-right, progressive-conservative, big governement-small governement, ...). A crucial feature of the political spectrum is that the origin is not fixed -- neither in time (the conservative aim to preserve the status quo is not what it was 200 years ago) nor in place (the "left" leaning Democratic party is a [center-right party when compared to European parties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_spectrum#Historical_origin_of_the_terms)). I think the political spectrum is interesting for two reasons. First of all: the lack of an origin means that, e.g., right-wing ideas can seem more "centrist" (i.e., moderate) when more extremist ideas are introduced. This has political consequences when politics are discussed within the spectrum (as they nearly always are).

**2a.** The "centrist" views of politics are forged with respect to the most extremist political views. Even when an extremist candidate/party fails to gain power, they still have the ability to shift the goalposts towards their view.  

Second of all
