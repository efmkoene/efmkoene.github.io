The topic of this blog is to investigate the following question:

{: .box-note}
Where do people's political stances come from? Can they change?

Political stances are, probably, the biggest source of disagreement and conflict in humans. They can ruin family reunions, dinner dates, and lead to physical harm. This is perhaps of little surprise. After all, politics deals with great power. The power to shape the future. Having a political stance thus corresponds to knowing an answer to the question _"what kind of world do you want?"_ The answers to this question can broadly be placed on a ["conservative-to-liberal" spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_spectrum). The conservative stance favors traditional values and the status quo (hence: the future should be like the present). The liberal stance favors change and a more egalitarian society (hence: the future should be different from the present). Next to this socio-cultural divide, parties can typically be divided as per ther economic stance (left-right).

The origin of a political spectrum is not fixed. For example, the Democratic party is perhaps a "left" leaning party in the US. However, in the context of European parties, the Democrats would be a decidedly [center-right party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_spectrum#Historical_origin_of_the_terms). 

Since the foundation of the USA, votes have primarily been divided between a conservative (Repubiclan) and a liberal (Democratic) party. For example, see the following [graph from Wikimedia](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/76/PartyVotes-Presidents.png) about presidential election results spanning over 300 years:

The conservative and liberal parties are fairly well balanced, both taking roughly half of the votes every year. The margin of one party over the other is never larger than 27%, and typically much smaller.
