# The intuitive mind
How happy are you these days? As remarked in [Thinking, Fast and Slow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow), this is a hard question!
In that book, it's told that we typically thinking in two ways: fast and slow. The fast system is the intuitive "gut" response, the slow system is the rational part of the brain. The most lovely example of the two systems is the following riddle,   
*A bat and a ball cost $1.10 in total. The bat costs $1 more than the ball. How much does the ball cost?*    
Without putting in any effort, your intuition will come back at you with the answer: $0.10!    
... But wait, that gives a total cost of $0.10+$1.10=$1.20, which is wrong!    
As told in the book, people who give the correct answer do *not* skip the intuitive wrong answer, they're merely better in suppressing this gut feeling momentarily!

*Thinking, Fast and Slow* is full of examples of this type.

There is another interesting point in *Thinking, Fast and Slow*, which remarks how easily the fast system can project answers onto any dimension.
One example to show the flexibility we have in this regard:    
*If Sam were as tall as he is intelligent, how tall would he be?*     
Say, this Sam would be a rather intelligent person. We would perhaps think    
*180 cm?*    
No, that feels to small    
*220 cm?*    
No, that seems a bit outlandish,      
*about 195 cm*       
Yeah, that feels about right.    
This response happens nearly effortlessly, despite there being no immediately obvious link between these two scales. Certainly not one that you typically encounter.

The key aspect is that we are given a **frame** that the answer should conform to: somewhere on the scale of normal human sizes. And giving such answers is remarkably simple.

In the same way, answering the question "how happy are you these days" is pretty hard. But if you had to give an answer to the question "how happy am I at this very moment, *on a scale of 0 to 10*", you would get an immediate response quickly and intuitively. The answer probably won't surprise you ("*that feels about right!*"), but certainly reveals more about your mood than you knew about yourself before you answered it, nonetheless.
Our exact emotional state may only be revealed to us when we interrogate ourselves. *(Note that I don't claim that you cannot be aware of feeling good or bad without these steps. Merely, knowing "exactly" how you feel is not something that happens automatically. Only by supplying a mental framework (e.g., testing for specific emotions, rating them from 0 to 10, ...) can we start to understand how we actually feel.)*

# Changing the scales
The above section has given us a way to make your inner emotional state tractable. You ask yourself a question ("how happy/angry/sad/hurt/overwhelmed/... do I feel at this moment, on a scale of 0 to 10?"), and you know the answer instantaneously, somehow, in a way and detail you didn't know before. In a one-liner: the dashboard to your feelings works by touch, not by vision.
I think that it's important to have such a tool available to yourself. 
Because, sometimes we think we feel a certain "hard" way (say, angry), when in reality a "soft" emotion lies underneath (say, we are feeling stressed, not listened to, insecure, or ...), but we simply miss our actual emotional state. 

Different emotions cause different actions (note the word *motion* within *emotion*!), so a better handle on your emotions can cause more pro-active and productive outcomes. That changing your inner world can change your behavior is the main assumption underlying [cognitive behavioral therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy) (CBT). CBT gives several methods to try and change one's behavior by *challenging* thoughts and feelings that cause negative effects.
In so-called "third-wave psychoterapies", influences from Eastern philosophies are included in CBT. These psychotherapy methods claim that the CBT method of trying to control the intensity of negative emotions only makes them stronger. This leads to paradoxical outcomes, e.g., [trying to be happy makes you miserable](https://time.com/5356657/trying-to-be-happy/).

So, what is the opposite of trying to control your thoughts/feelings? The answer is *accepting* your thoughts/feelings. That can be pretty hard in and by itself. But the third-wave methods go about this by projecting your feelings onto **physical** and **personal** scales, rather than graded scales. What that means is that the question    
*"how do I feel X right now, on a scale of 0 to 10?"*,    
gets replaced with    
*"how do I feel X right now, as a bodily sensation?"*,     
or    
*"how do I feel X right now, if it were a person?"*.    
The fact that people can answer these questions at all is the magic of how the intuitive mind can produce answers in arbitrary dimensions. Despite the lack of logic in the questions, there is a gut-response. An answer.

The key aspect of the latter two questions is two-fold. First of all, the answers are not graded. If one day you feel your stress as a knot in the pit of your stomach, and another you feel your stress as a heavyness pressing on your lungs, then any comparison between the two is essentially meaningless. The bodily sensation just "is" what it is, today. This allows an acceptance of your feelings. Second of all, it gives you a way to approach your feelings.
For example, you can realize that your stress is just a knot in your stomach! The rest of your body still works as it did before. Emotions don't have to overwhelm you -- you, physically, are bigger than what bugs you!
Or, if you imagine your emotions as characters living within you, [as in the Pixar movie Inside Out (2015)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside_Out_(2015_film)), you can see whether these characters are really trying to tell you something (in the way that angry emotions may actually reflect underlying emotions of insecurity), and whether there is something positive that can be done with it. 

In other words, third-wave psychotherapies *ask different questions about feelings*. What we care about is not how we grade our emotions (not "a little", or "a lot", or "7/10"), but how we can conceptualize them as physical or personal features. [The effect is real and significant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_Relationship_Focusing). I can attest to this.
