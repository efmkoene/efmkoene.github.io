# Introduction
[Quark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark_(dairy_product)) is a popular dairy product. 
It could be seen as a thicker, more protein-rich and more sour version of yoghurt.
In practice, it is supposed to be a *cheese*, albeit a very soft one. 
Indeed, in Belgium this product is called *flat cheese* (plattekaas), and in France sometimes *fresh cheese* (fromage frais).
The stuff you find in the supermarket, conversely, is often not made following a cheese procedure, but made by concentrating milk in a [centrifuge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrifuge).
It turns out that making quark, as a cheese, is extremely easy, and the product you end up with is richer and more creamy than the one you buy in the supermarket.
(it is not, however, cheaper -- but again, you'll end up with a different product!).

What you need is:

1. Milk (1L)
2. Buttermilk (a tablespoon)
3. [Rennet](https://www.faie.ch/direkt-vermarktung/kaesereibedarf/kaesereiartikel/kaeselab-kulturen/7109464/kaeselab-50ml?c=78065003) (one drop)
4. [A cheesecloth](https://www.faie.ch/direkt-vermarktung/kaesereibedarf/kaesereiartikel/kaesereiartikel-literatur/7043352/kaesetuch-aus-baumwolle)
5. A sieve
6. A bowl

I found that, in Switzerland, it's not easy to find the required special ingredients (rennet and a cheese cloth). They can only be bought in two places, as far as I know: [faie.ch](faie.ch) and [winklerag.ch](winklerag.ch). 
Note that rennet and the cheese cloth can also be used for making other cheeses at home, e.g., [halloumi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPNQmV7roos).
You can thus use these products for other home-made dairy products!

# Recipe
## 1. Gather milk and buttermilk
![step1](../assets/img/quark_milk_and_buttermilk.jpg)

Get a pack of one liter of milk (I recommend milk with 2+%, for a creamy taste). Get a pack from the cooled section of the supermarket. That is pasteurized milk, but not UHT.
Additionally, grab a small amount of buttermilk from the supermarket. This will contain acid and bacteria which will sour the milk further.

## 2. Acidify and culture
![step2](../assets/img/quark_milk_in_buttermilk.jpg)

You "activate" the milk by adding a bit of the buttermilk, which will introduce acid and bacteria into the milk and turn the product sour and start the culturing process. You only need a tablespoon, which you simply add into the pack. Shake, and put it back down.

Close the pack of milk again, by putting the lid back on.

Wait for 12-24 hours.

## 3. Add rennet (start cheese-making)
![step3](../assets/img/quark_add_renet.jpg)

Add one drop (!) of rennet to the cheese.
